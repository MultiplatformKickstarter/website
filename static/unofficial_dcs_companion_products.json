            "descriptionExtended": "The F-4 Phantom II is an American two-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, long- range supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber originally developed by McDonnell Aircraft for the United States Navy. After entering service with the Navy in 1961, it became adopted by the United States Marine Corps and United States Air Force. Due to its high adaptability, versatility and for its time, unparalleled capabilities, it quickly turned into the main workhorse for all 3 branches and spread beyond the borders of the United States, going on to serve and protect 12 nations across the world, with Phantoms still in operation today. Its production ran from 1958 to 1981, and with nigh 5200 Phantoms built, it became the most produced supersonic US military aircraft in the history, solidifying its place as one of the most recognizable and well known aircraft of the cold war era. \n\nIt truly was an iconic and phabulous aircraft that, at its time, had unrivaled power and capabilities. It instilled a sense of wonder and awe, a beast that announced itself only with thunder. Unmatched in character and impression it was without equal, from the first time it took to the skies. A primeval spirit in aircraft form, it delivered shock that rattled to the core and protected many nations across the globe. While both an interceptor and potent air to air fighter, it proved its multirole capabilities as a true air to ground workhorse, and packed a serious punch. This unprecedented mission agility was reason enough for its lifetime to span well over six decades, continuing even today, and will translate to the rendition of DCS: F-4E Phantom II, as you fly and utilize its wide variety of weaponry across a broad spectrum of mission content. \n\nOutstanding features of the aircraft are the powerful J- 79 twin engines with a dry thrust of 23,810 lbf and a max afterburner thrust of 35,690 lbf, a crew of two, the powerful AN/APQ-120 Radar, the Digital Scan Converter Group (DSCG), the Weapons Release Computer Set (WRCS), the Aircraft Weapons Release Unit (AWRU) and an Altitude Reference and Bombing Computer Set (ARBCS). The DSCG version of the F-4E also comes with the AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod, allowing for precision strikes and the (self-)-employment of laser guided ammunition. Additionally the F-4E can carry the AGM-65 Maverick, a wide array of iron and both TV and laser guided bombs, as well as the capability to carry out Wild Weasel (SEAD) tasks in a limited capacity with the AGM-45 Shrike. \n\nUnlike previous Phantom variants, the -E comes equipped with an integrated M61 Vulcan cannon that can be used both in an air to ground and air to air role. It has an optical sight that allows for lead computing optical sighting (LCOS) in air to air, as well as the ability to carry additional Vulcan cannon pods. It can protect itself with the ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver, the AN/ALE-40 countermeasures suite, the AN/ALQ-131 ECM pod, KY-28 encryption equipment and employs a range of early to modern era AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow missiles for aerial combat that can be also used through the additional specialized CAGED and computer automatic acquisition (CAA) modes.\n\nThe Heatblur Simulations F-4E Phantom II aims to simulate this iconic aircraft as a high-fidelity module for DCS, being the culmination of several years of research, coding and modeling.\n\nSpecial points of consideration amongst the many features are the external and internal graphic model created using laser scanning and photogrammetry from real Phantoms at various museums, the detailed External Flight Model (EFM) developed over the past several years and verified by real F-4 pilots and WSOs, the detailed modeling of the AN/APQ- 120 radar and the various systems on board and the ability to fly as a two- crew aircraft in multiplayer, as well as the proprietary JESTER-AI helping you as your AI-WSO in singleplayer. \n\nKey features of the Heatblur Simulations DCS: F-4E Phantom II include:\n\nThe simulation of both the DSCG and DMAS equipped -E variants, the DMAS version following later during the Early Access period.\n\nHighly-detailed external model that is built using laser scanning and photogrammetry taken of real F-4 Phantoms across the globe.\n\nNew weapon models for some of the F-4 Phantom payloads like the AGM-45 Shrike, the AGM-12 Bullpup, the AGM-62 Walleye, and AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod.\n\nHighly-detailed and accurate 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) cockpit that is also built using photogrammetry from the F-4 Phantoms preserved at museums, including Heatblur FORGE elements to be added later during Early Access.\n\nHighly-detailed and accurate pilot and WSO models that will eventually match the many liveries and different nations. Later, during early access, a full character customization system will allow you to customize your pilot and pick and match various equipment to stylize your crew.\n\nHighly-accurate, F-4 pilot and WSO verified, External Flight Model (EFM) based on real performance data.\n\nAccurate aircraft systems simulation featuring:\n\nThe Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS).\n\nDetailed electrical system that accurately simulates sources, current, and consumption. It includes realistic circuits and power draw for every connected device.\n\nDetailed Hydraulic System that simulates the flow of hydraulic liquid. This ultimately moves the hydraulics which in turn move the various flight surfaces, etc.\n\nDetailed and accurate oil and fuel system. \n\nMass based physics system, allowing for unprecedented simulation of moving surfaces, with realistic behavior according to their mass and properties.\n\nFully functional multi crew that allows a two-seat functionality in multiplayer. This allows a player as pilot to team up with another player as the Weapon Systems Officer, WSO.\n\nJESTER AI 2.0: Heablur’s new and improved lifelike AI that fills the role of the WSO when flying in singleplayer or multiplayer without a human WSO. JESTER AI 2.0 expands functionality, dialogue options, and more.\n\nA simulated Crew Chief for a more immersive and complete startup procedure.\n\nLater during early access, a brand new walkaround mode allows you to do pre-flight checks on your aircraft.\n\nA new versatile set of UI features that allows for live in-cockpit viewing of the manual and the ability to interact with the various settings and options pertaining to your mission and flight. This feature will be continually expanded during Early Access.\n\nIntroducing Heatblur Interactive Tooltips that provide the ability to click on a switch and be directly taken to the relevant manual part without ever leaving your cockpit. \n\nNew and improved effects like advanced overwing vapors, new procedural animation systems, and more.\n\nDetailed and highly accurate simulations of the AN/APQ-120 radar and ALR-46 RWR.\n\nA detailed simulation of the AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod that allows the WSO to guide laser guided munitions dropped by the pilot or other aircraft (buddy-lasing).\n\nA comprehensive digital manual, both as a PDF and as a continually updated online manual. It is directly accessible from within the cockpit at any time via Interactive Tooltips and/or the EBAG.\n\nA complete set of interactive and voiced tutorials.\n\nA comprehensive set of missions and campaigns to be gradually released during Early Access and beyond.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Some features may not be available immediately at Early Access. The later F-4E DMAS equipped variant, including Pave Tack and TISEO, will follow during the Early Access period and the tutorials and campaigns will be implemented and expanded during Early Access as well. \n\n\nFree disk space is required: 8 Gb",

Armed with a 30mm Chain Gun under the nose, Hellfire missiles and 2.75” rockets on the stub wings, the AH-64D proved its mettle in Iraq and Afghanistan against a wide array of threats.\n\nThe aircraft is powered by two T-700-GE-701C engines, and enjoys provisions for both external and internal/supplemented fuel tanks for long mission duration. Protecting the crew stations and critical elements, the AH-64D is designed to be capable of sustaining small to medium-caliber fire. The Aircraft Survivability Equipment (ASE) system includes missile, laser, and radar warning sensors, a radar jammer, and expendable countermeasures.\n\nThe AH-64D is a very capable platform at night thanks to the Pilot Night Vision System (PNVS) and an advanced Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor that is part of the Target Acquisition and Designation Sight (TADS). AH-64D pilots are equipped with the Integrated Helmet and Display Sighting System (IHADSS) that projects flight, sensor, and weapon information to their right eye. They can simply look at a target to engage it.\n\nIn addition to the U.S. Army, AH-64D variants have also served with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Japan, Egypt, Greece, and more.\n\nLater in development, our AH-64D will also be equipped with the Fire Control Radar (FCR) that will enable it to detect, classify, track, and engage both air and surface targets with radar-guided Hellfire missiles.\n\nKey Features of DCS: AH-64D\n\nAt Early Access release:\n\nProfessional flight dynamics and engine modelling with high precision characteristics of the real aircraft in all ranges of altitude, temperature and speeds for different weights and flight configurations\nTwo 6DOF highly detailed cockpits and external model\nFully clickable cockpits with mouse interactive control\nMulti-crew. A second crew member can be another player or the \"George\" AI\nDetailed modeling of the entire electrical, fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, fire protection, SCAS, hold modes, and radio systems\nFull modeling of armament and weapons systems with ability to use 30mm chain gun, 2.75” rockets, and AGM-114K Hellfire anti tank guided missiles in Direct, Low, and High modes\nExternal fuel tanks\nIHADSS, MPNVS, and MTADS/TEDAC systems and sensors\nLinear Motion Compensator (LMC)\nTactical Situation Display (TSD) with moving map\nDefensive systems that include the Common Missile Warning System, chaff and flare dispensers, and radar warning receiver\nU.S. Army and Other Paint Schemes\nNight Vision Goggles\nSearch Light\nEarly Access Manual\nTraining Missions\nAt final release:\n\nFire Control Radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI)\nAddition of the AGM-114L Radar-Guided Hellfire\nData Link System to share and assign targets between flight members\nTADS Multi-Target Tracker (MTT)\nLaser Warning System\nRadar Jammer\nAnti-Ice System\nAdvanced Damage Modeling\nAdditional liveries and livery template\nFull English (full list of languages is TBD)\nCampaign by Eagle Dynamics\nLocalization:\n\nCockpit\tEnglish\nRadio\tEnglish\nManual\tEnglish, German\n\nFree disk space is required: 1.95 Gb",

            "description": "The P-51D Mustang is not only one of the most iconic aircraft ever built, it is also arguably the most effective all-round fighter-bomber of WW2. Armed with six .50 caliber Browning machine guns, the Mustang was also able to carry either two bombs or up to ten unguided rockets.\n\nThe Mustang began combat operations with the RAF in April 1942, immediately proving its effectiveness both as a fighter and in ‘Rhubarb’ low-level fighter-bomber attacks against enemy airfields, supply trains and in the close air support role. It was especially dominant in dogfights above 20,000. With its graceful lines, distinctive bubble canopy and clipped wings, the ‘D’ variant rapidly became the mainstay of the United States 8th Air Force in Europe.\n\nLocalization: Chinese, Deutsch, English, French, Russian\n\nFree disk space is required: 700 Mb",

It was especially dominant in dogfights above 20,000. With its graceful lines, distinctive bubble canopy and clipped wings, the ‘D’ variant rapidly became the mainstay of the United States 8th Air Force in Europe.\n\nPowered by the Packard V-1650-7, a license-built version of the two-speed, two-stage supercharged Rolls-Royce Merlin 66, the Mustang had a maximum speed of 390 miles per hour and a combat range of roughly 750 miles (1,200 km). The use of external drop tanks increased the P-51D’s operational range to 1,375 miles (2,200 km), enabling it to escort Allied bombers on long-range missions to the heart of Germany. The P-51D played a major role in establishing Allied air superiority during the June, 1944 D-Day invasion of Normandy, and in maintaining air supremacy as Allied forces fought their way towards Berlin.\n\nMustang pilots chalked up almost 5,000 victories over enemy aircraft in WW2. The DCS: P-51D is a superb module. Fly it and see for yourself.\n\nKey Features:\n\nThe DCS: P-51D Mustang offers the most authentic, highly-detailed simulation of the P-51D Mustang ever created. There are options for both hard-core and casual game players\nSimulation mode: Enjoy the thrill of flying this warbird and operating its weapons against a wide range of ground and airborne targets.\nAn Interactive Training System: puts you in the cockpit with an instructor who guides you step-by-step through learning to fly and fight the Mustang.\nMission Editor: allows you to create your own missions and campaigns.\nFly online: with a built-in server browser that supports up to 32 players in both head-to-head and co-operative gameplay. Fly online with other DCS aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Bf109, Spitfire IX and FW-190. Attack ground targets from the WW2 Assets Pack.\nFree disk space is required: 700 Mb",

It was also known as ‘Freeman’s Folly’ after the Air Marshal who backed its production.\n\nArmed with four 7.7mm (.303in) Browning machine guns and four 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk.II cannons, this superbly versatile fighter-bomber could carry both bomb and rocket payloads over long distances at high speed – and deliver them with pinpoint accuracy.\n\nThe Mossie’s ability to maintain a high cruising speed at high altitude made it very difficult for Luftwaffe fighters to intercept it.\n\nThe DCS: Mosquito FB VI fighter-bomber you will be flying is the most impressive variant of this aircraft to see action in WWII. A total of 2,140 were produced.\n\nEquipped with more powerful Rolls-Royce Merlin 25 engines, the FB Mk. VI’s excellent handling characteristics make it a pleasure to fly.\n\nEarly Access Features:\n\nHigh-quality external 3D model\n6 Degree of Freedom fully clickable cockpit with latest visual effects\nFlight Dynamics based on official reports, our own CFD research and pilot feedback\nFull Fuel system and optional external tanks\nFull electrical system\nFull hydraulic and pneumatic system\nPropeller feathering\nRadio units T1154 (transmitter) & R1155 (receiver)\nSupport of the new internal structure-based damage model\nEarly Access Armament:\n\n4 British Browning .303 machine guns\n4 Hispano Mk.II 20mm guns\n250lbs and 500lbs bombs in the bomb bay and under each wing\nFree disk space is required: 900 Mb",

Even the P-51D Mustang and the Mk.IX Spitfire struggled to match it in a dogfight. When they did land rounds on it, the Anton’s side and rear cockpit armour and armoured engine cowling made it harder to down.\n\nThe A-8 could also be loaded with unguided rockets and bombs, including the giant, Werfer-Granate 21 cm spin-stabilised rocket. This delivered a 40.8 kg (90 lb) warhead with a lethal blast area of about 30 metres (100 ft). Launched into massed Allied bomber fleets by packs of Antons, where they didn’t actually bring down the bombers, these mighty munitions forced the tight formations to split, leaving individual aircraft open to attack.\n\nA powerful BMW 801D-2 14-cylinder radial engine gave the Anton a top speed of 654 km/h (408 mph) and an initial climb rate of 720 m (2,363 ft) per minute. \n\nStrong, wide-track undercarriage allowed the Fw 190A-8 to operate from rough front-line airfields. More than 6,650 Fw 190 variants were produced in the last two years of the war. Many of the Luftwaffe's aces racked up their impressive victory counts in the Anton, but you can match it in the Spitfire Mk IX. Try both and see who comes out on top.\n\nKey features:\n\nUnmatched flight physics give a real feeling of what it's like to fly and fight this legend.\nHighly detailed, six-degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) cockpit.\nMouse-interactive cockpit controls.\nDetailed, accurate modelling of the Fw 190A-8’s instruments, weapons, engine, radios, fuel systems and squadron markings.\nBattle the Spitfire LF Mk.IX and P-51D Mustang in single and multiplayer games.\nFree disk space is required: 1.46 Gb",

The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the United States Marine Corps in January 1985. It later evolved into the AV-8B N/A (Night Attack) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus.\n\nFirst flight of a modified AV-8B in the night attack configuration was on June 26th, 1987. Deliveries to the USMC began in September of 1989 to VMA-214 at Yuma, Arizona. Follow-up units based out of Yuma received their Night Attack AV-8Bs by the end of 1992.The AV-8B N/A variant (originally known as the AV-8D) had its first operational development in 1984 and included use of the NAVFLIR (Navigation Forward-Looking Infrared camera, consisting of a GEC-Marconi FLIR system mounted in the nose) for night operations. Additionally, GEC Cat's Eyes night vision goggles were provided to the pilot as well as a revised cockpit with color MFDs, a wider field-of-view HUD display, a color CRT digital moving map, and a complete \"heads-down\" operation capability. The AV-8B N/A also sports four Tracor ALE-39 countermeasures dispensers along the top of the rear fuselage, in addition to two ALE-39 dispensers along the lower rear of the fuselage. The AV-8B N/A also fields an updated version of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus 11-61 (F402-RR-408) vectored-thrust turbofan engine.\n\nThe subject of this study level simulation is the AV-8B N/A Bu No's 163853 and up which are the latest variant of this very capable AV-8B version.\n\nKey Features of DCS: AV-8B N/A VTOL by RAZBAM include:\n\nAdvanced Flight Model that provides realistic performance and flight characteristics of a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft\nHighly detailed external 3D model and textures with animations\nHighly detailed and accurate 6 DOF cockpit with high resolution textures, specular and bump mapping, and mouse-interactive controls\nHighly realistic modelling of the aircraft systems including electrical, fuel, hydraulics, lighting, engine and navigation that includes:\nDigital Engine Control System (DECS)\nAutomatic Fuel System\nAir Refueling System\nElectrical Power System\nExternal Lighting\nInternal Lighting\nHydraulic Power Supply System\nFlight Control System (FCS)\nHead-Up Display (HUD)\nUp-front Control (UFC)\nOption Display Unit (ODU)\nMultipurpose Color Displays (MPCD)\nVREST Computer (for jet-borne flight)\nAir Data Computer (ADC)\nEnvironmental Control System (ECS)\nOn-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS)\nRealistic weapons, sensor, and defensive systems include:\nAir-to-Air and Air-to-Ground GAU-12 Equalizer 25 mm (0.984 in) 5-barreled Rotary cannon pod\n6 under-wing pylon stations holding up to 9,200 lb (4,200 kg) of payload which include:\nAIM-9 Sidewinder or similar-sized infrared-guided missiles\nAGM-65 Maverick Air-to-Surface missiles\nMark 80 series of unguided bombs (including 3 kg [6.6 lb] and 14 kg [31 lb] practice bombs)\nPaveway series of Laser-Guided Bombs (LGBs)\nJoint Direct Attack Munitions (GBU-38, GBU-32, and GBU-54)\nMark 20 Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs)\nAN/AAQ-28V LITENING targeting pod\nALQ-164 ECM Pod\nSeveral skins\nDetailed Operational Manual and Pocket guide\nInstant Action, Single, and Training Missions\nDetailed representation of the USS Tarawa (LHA-1), lead ship of her class.\nFor more information and support, please visit: RAZBAM\n\nFree disk space is required: 2.25 Gb",

At the same time, the full-fidelity physics of the original model is preserved, providing the same professional-level flight characteristics and sense of flight. This version of the F-5E FC is available both as part of bundle DCS: Flaming Cliffs 2024 and as a dedicated module purchase.\n\nThe F-5E is a light, tactical fighter based on the F-5A in 1972. A distinctive feature of the F-5E is its improved aerodynamics that include leading edge wing extensions and automatic control of high lift devices that improved the maneuverability of the aircraft. The sighting system was also improved to include the AN/APQ-159 radar.\n\nThe aircraft has two built-in 20mm cannons and can carry two AIM-9 short range, infrared-guided air-to-air missiles and various air-to-ground, and unguided weapons.\n\nLocalization: English, Russian\n\nFree disk space is required: 500 Mb",

The map also includes large areas of the Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea to the north and west, ideal for aircraft carrier operations. The Orbx DCS: Kola map is represented in its current-day state, with some allowance for late-Cold War military features and functionality.\n\nThe Kola map spans about 1,400 km east-west by 1,000 km north-south, with more than 575,000 sq km of land and a total coverage area of ~1,350,000 sq km. Its southern boundary roughly aligns with 65 degrees latitude, meaning most of the map area falls within the Arctic Circle. The Kola map covers various natural landscapes, from the dramatic fjords and island chains to vast forested areas with myriad lakes and wetlands, to rugged mountains, to the Arctic tundra. Cities, towns, mines, ports, and infrastructure corridors, all have unique characteristics determined by their location and cultural association.\n\nFree disk space is required: 145 Gb",

It is claimed its territory was captured by a caliphate, within which it enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia. The group, which was designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, received universal condemnation for its human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. The Iraqi government formally requested of the United States and wider international community, they begin airstrikes against ISIL in support of their fight on the ground. During the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pressed Ministers of Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and the United Kingdom to support a coalition to combat ISIL militarily and financially. The United States launched the Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) on 17 October with the stated aim of degrading and destroying ISIL.\n\nLocalization: English\n\nRequirements:\n\nDCS: AH-64D\nDCS: Syria Map",
