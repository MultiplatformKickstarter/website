# Create multiplatform applications within minutes

Developed by industry veterans, *Multiplatform Kickstarter* is going to be the first **Open Source** *template* that will help you to kickstart your business.

Most templates only solves the basic functionality, we are aiming to solve most of the common problems when creating applications from initial status to production.

Based in **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)** and in conjunction with **Compose Multiplatform**, with few simple steps you will have up and running applications for **Android**, **iOS** and **Desktop** using **Ktor** as the server. (and in the near future also **Web**)

It will be available on *late 2023*.
