Nicknamed the ‘Jug’, its eight M2 Browning .50-calibre (12.7 mm) machine guns packed a devastating punch: the P-47D could fire 3,400 rounds of ammunition in a continuous, 30-second stream of high-explosive lead, shredding any enemy aircraft in its sights.\n\nWith a bubble canopy providing great all-round visibility, a range of 1,000 miles at 10,000 feet and a massive 18-cylinder, 2,600-horsepower R-2800-59 Double Wasp turbocharged radial engine giving it a top speed of 428 mph, the Jug acted as a highly effective Allied bomber escort in raids on Nazi-occupied Europe. More than twice the weight of the Spitfire, its sheer size, rugged construction and armoured cockpit meant the P-47D could shrug off astonishing amounts of enemy fire.\n\nLocalization: English","cover":"https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/811/DCS_P-47D_700x1000_v3.jpg","images":["https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/3e2/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-12-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/366/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-11-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/770/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-10-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/536/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-09-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/895/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-08-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/c37/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-07-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/d31/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-06-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/85d/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-05-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/834/dcs-world-p47d-thunderbolt-04-flight-simulator.jpg"],"video":"zGFwlbKdqkY","category":"PLANES","miles":4990,"released":"2023-5-12T16:35","modified":"2023-5-12T16:35","versionRequired":"2.5.6","bundle":"","price":49.99,"discountedPrice":0.0,"isSteamCompatible":false,"isEarlyAccess":false,"isPrePurchase":false},{"id":19,"title":"DCS: JF-17 Thunder by Deka Ironwork Simulations","description":"JF-17 is a single seat, single engine, multirole light fighter that was joint developed by AVIC Chengdu and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC). The design phase of JF-17 \"Thunder\" finished at May 31st, 2002, and the maiden flight was made on August 25th, 2003. The first plane delivered to PAF (Pakistan Air Force) in 2007. Currently several different blocks of JF-17s are in service in Pakistan and Myanmar air forces. There are also several countries interested in purchasing this fighter jet. On February 27th, 2019, \"Thunder\" has withstood the test of actual combat and helped PAF win an appreciable victory.\n\n\"Thunder\" is a type of fighter that specifically tailored for PAF. The development plan of her predecessor can even be traced back to 1985. At first, PAF was only looking for a fighter that can replace Shenyang J-6 (Chinese version of Mig-19), but they were not satisfied with Chengdu’s J-7M. After more than 20 years of development, the final product \"Thunder\" becomes completely different from J-7M.\nLocalization: English, Chinese\n\nFree disk space is required: 1.61 Gb","cover":"https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/876/JF17-Cover-700x1000.jpg","images":["https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/85e/dcs-jf17-16-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/623/dcs-jf17-15-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/9f2/dcs-jf17-14-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/efb/dcs-jf17-13-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/5d0/dcs-jf17-12-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/cf1/dcs-jf17-11-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/711/dcs-jf17-10-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/bbc/dcs-jf17-09-flight-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/f9b/dcs-jf17-08-flight-simulator.jpg"],"video":"90FE2ln9rz8","category":"PLANES","miles":7990,"released":"2023-5-12T16:35","modified":"2023-5-12T16:35","versionRequired":"2.5.5","bundle":"","price":79.99,"discountedPrice":0.0,"isSteamCompatible":false,"isEarlyAccess":true,"isPrePurchase":false},{"id":20,"title":"DCS: AH-64D The Four Horsemen Campaign by Fight's On Simulationss","description":"In 2014, the militant group Islamic State made vast territorial gains in Iraq and Syria following several offensives. It is claimed its territory was captured by a caliphate, within which it enforced a strict interpretation of Sharia. The group, which was designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, received universal condemnation for its human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. The Iraqi government formally requested of the United States and wider international community, they begin airstrikes against ISIL in support of their fight on the ground. During the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pressed Ministers of Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, and the United Kingdom to support a coalition to combat ISIL militarily and financially. The United States launched the Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) on 17 October with the stated aim of degrading and destroying ISIL.\n\nLocalization: English\n\nRequirements:\n\nDCS: AH-64D\nDCS: Syria Map","cover":"https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/113/fizz3b0jvtgl4oridrzjv9wbdu78jljf/dcs-ah-64d-the-four-horsemen-campaign.jpg","images":["https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/040/yf5o6yxxhkd4wv7de8gcr7a920k80gng/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-22.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/fae/tmisy2o7pu5jx26r4tt00t83yep36yxr/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-20.png.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/416/z8qi62xdvtm3dtvbp41ktpd5u3kkxqwv/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-19.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/18d/ia0c5i3v0ee6l249rn0j4s1s18em06pi/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-18.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/480/c19vg4pyrm268jp12omw5a2llypt6nyb/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-17.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/a6b/u4ne0fhz3as0ysu3n61zumyzeosjys1l/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-16.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/a99/u1ve1hb5jzd1xc72zapiryyalypb2wlx/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-15.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/0fb/pf0kk5nhpns4tko598xdl5po0qn1ndep/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-14.png","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/5af/fg2fp4nbrr1nwvkyy2pa0p6alupd8psh/ah64d-helicopter-flight-simulator-13.png"],"video":"EcnIjjDqG7c","category":"CAMPAIGNS","miles":6390,"released":"2023-5-12T16:35","modified":"2023-5-12T16:35","versionRequired":"2.9.6","bundle":"","price":13.99,"discountedPrice":0.0,"isSteamCompatible":false,"isEarlyAccess":false,"isPrePurchase":false},{"id":21,"title":"DCS: Sinai Map by OnReTech","description":"The DCS: Sinai map is focused on the Sinai Peninsula, located between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba with eastern Egypt to the west and southern Israel to the east.
