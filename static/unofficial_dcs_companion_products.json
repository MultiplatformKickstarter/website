Its production ran from 1958 to 1981, and with nigh 5200 Phantoms built, it became the most produced supersonic US military aircraft in the history, solidifying its place as one of the most recognizable and well known aircraft of the cold war era. \n\nIt truly was an iconic and phabulous aircraft that, at its time, had unrivaled power and capabilities. It instilled a sense of wonder and awe, a beast that announced itself only with thunder. Unmatched in character and impression it was without equal, from the first time it took to the skies. A primeval spirit in aircraft form, it delivered shock that rattled to the core and protected many nations across the globe. While both an interceptor and potent air to air fighter, it proved its multirole capabilities as a true air to ground workhorse, and packed a serious punch. This unprecedented mission agility was reason enough for its lifetime to span well over six decades, continuing even today, and will translate to the rendition of DCS: F-4E Phantom II, as you fly and utilize its wide variety of weaponry across a broad spectrum of mission content. \n\nOutstanding features of the aircraft are the powerful J- 79 twin engines with a dry thrust of 23,810 lbf and a max afterburner thrust of 35,690 lbf, a crew of two, the powerful AN/APQ-120 Radar, the Digital Scan Converter Group (DSCG), the Weapons Release Computer Set (WRCS), the Aircraft Weapons Release Unit (AWRU) and an Altitude Reference and Bombing Computer Set (ARBCS). The DSCG version of the F-4E also comes with the AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod, allowing for precision strikes and the (self-)-employment of laser guided ammunition. Additionally the F-4E can carry the AGM-65 Maverick, a wide array of iron and both TV and laser guided bombs, as well as the capability to carry out Wild Weasel (SEAD) tasks in a limited capacity with the AGM-45 Shrike. \n\nUnlike previous Phantom variants, the -E comes equipped with an integrated M61 Vulcan cannon that can be used both in an air to ground and air to air role. It has an optical sight that allows for lead computing optical sighting (LCOS) in air to air, as well as the ability to carry additional Vulcan cannon pods. It can protect itself with the ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver, the AN/ALE-40 countermeasures suite, the AN/ALQ-131 ECM pod, KY-28 encryption equipment and employs a range of early to modern era AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow missiles for aerial combat that can be also used through the additional specialized CAGED and computer automatic acquisition (CAA) modes.\n\nThe Heatblur Simulations F-4E Phantom II aims to simulate this iconic aircraft as a high-fidelity module for DCS, being the culmination of several years of research, coding and modeling.\n\nSpecial points of consideration amongst the many features are the external and internal graphic model created using laser scanning and photogrammetry from real Phantoms at various museums, the detailed External Flight Model (EFM) developed over the past several years and verified by real F-4 pilots and WSOs, the detailed modeling of the AN/APQ- 120 radar and the various systems on board and the ability to fly as a two- crew aircraft in multiplayer, as well as the proprietary JESTER-AI helping you as your AI-WSO in singleplayer. \n\nKey features of the Heatblur Simulations DCS: F-4E Phantom II include:\n\nThe simulation of both the DSCG and DMAS equipped -E variants, the DMAS version following later during the Early Access period.\n\nHighly-detailed external model that is built using laser scanning and photogrammetry taken of real F-4 Phantoms across the globe.\n\nNew weapon models for some of the F-4 Phantom payloads like the AGM-45 Shrike, the AGM-12 Bullpup, the AGM-62 Walleye, and AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod.\n\nHighly-detailed and accurate 6-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) cockpit that is also built using photogrammetry from the F-4 Phantoms preserved at museums, including Heatblur FORGE elements to be added later during Early Access.\n\nHighly-detailed and accurate pilot and WSO models that will eventually match the many liveries and different nations. Later, during early access, a full character customization system will allow you to customize your pilot and pick and match various equipment to stylize your crew.\n\nHighly-accurate, F-4 pilot and WSO verified, External Flight Model (EFM) based on real performance data.\n\nAccurate aircraft systems simulation featuring:\n\nThe Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS).\n\nDetailed electrical system that accurately simulates sources, current, and consumption.

The F-14 was the US Navy's frontline fighter from the 1970s to the mid-2000s. Over the course of its long service it also became one of the US Navy‚Äôs premier precision ground-attack platform and its lone airborne reconnaissance asset.\n\nNoteworthy features of the Tomcat are its swing-wing configuration, two-man crew, and the powerful AN/AWG-9 Weapons Control System (WCS) and radar.

The F-14 was the US Navy's frontline fighter from the 1970s to the mid-2000s. Over the course of its long service it also became one of the US Navy‚Äôs premier precision ground-attack platform and its lone airborne reconnaissance asset.\n\nNoteworthy features of the Tomcat are its swing-wing configuration, two-man crew, and the powerful AN/AWG-9 Weapons Control System (WCS) and radar. The AWG-9 allows employment of the long-range AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missile, and the LANTIRN targeting pod allows precision ground strikes using laser-guided bombs. The F-14 Tomcat was present in several historic events that include the two Gulf of Sidra incidents, Operations Desert Storm Iraqi Freedom, the Yugoslavian conflict, and Operation Enduring Freedom over Afghanistan. It was also immortalized in the iconic motion picture, Top Gun, and starred in several other feature films including The Final Countdown, Executive Decision, and others.\n\nThe Tomcat was also played a vital role in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, where is flew for the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force.

The use of external drop tanks increased the P-51D‚Äôs operational range to 1,375 miles (2,200 km), enabling it to escort Allied bombers on long-range missions to the heart of Germany. The P-51D played a major role in establishing Allied air superiority during the June, 1944 D-Day invasion of Normandy, and in maintaining air supremacy as Allied forces fought their way towards Berlin.\n\nMustang pilots chalked up almost 5,000 victories over enemy aircraft in WW2. The DCS: P-51D is a superb module. Fly it and see for yourself.\n\nKey Features:\n\nThe DCS: P-51D Mustang offers the most authentic, highly-detailed simulation of the P-51D Mustang ever created. There are options for both hard-core and casual game players\nSimulation mode: Enjoy the thrill of flying this warbird and operating its weapons against a wide range of ground and airborne targets.\nAn Interactive Training System: puts you in the cockpit with an instructor who guides you step-by-step through learning to fly and fight the Mustang.\nMission Editor: allows you to create your own missions and campaigns.\nFly online: with a built-in server browser that supports up to 32 players in both head-to-head and co-operative gameplay. Fly online with other DCS aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Bf109, Spitfire IX and FW-190.

It later evolved into the AV-8B N/A (Night Attack) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus.\n\nFirst flight of a modified AV-8B in the night attack configuration was on June 26th, 1987. Deliveries to the USMC began in September of 1989 to VMA-214 at Yuma, Arizona. Follow-up units based out of Yuma received their Night Attack AV-8Bs by the end of 1992.The AV-8B N/A variant (originally known as the AV-8D) had its first operational development in 1984 and included use of the NAVFLIR (Navigation Forward-Looking Infrared camera, consisting of a GEC-Marconi FLIR system mounted in the nose) for night operations. Additionally, GEC Cat's Eyes night vision goggles were provided to the pilot as well as a revised cockpit with color MFDs, a wider field-of-view HUD display, a color CRT digital moving map, and a complete \"heads-down\" operation capability. The AV-8B N/A also sports four Tracor ALE-39 countermeasures dispensers along the top of the rear fuselage, in addition to two ALE-39 dispensers along the lower rear of the fuselage. The AV-8B N/A also fields an updated version of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus 11-61 (F402-RR-408) vectored-thrust turbofan engine.\n\nThe subject of this study level simulation is the AV-8B N/A Bu No's 163853 and up which are the latest variant of this very capable AV-8B version.\n\nKey Features of DCS: AV-8B N/A VTOL by RAZBAM include:\n\nAdvanced Flight Model that provides realistic performance and flight characteristics of a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft\nHighly detailed external 3D model and textures with animations\nHighly detailed and accurate 6 DOF cockpit with high resolution textures, specular and bump mapping, and mouse-interactive controls\nHighly realistic modelling of the aircraft systems including electrical, fuel, hydraulics, lighting, engine and navigation that includes:\nDigital Engine Control System (DECS)\nAutomatic Fuel System\nAir Refueling System\nElectrical Power System\nExternal Lighting\nInternal Lighting\nHydraulic Power Supply System\nFlight Control System (FCS)\nHead-Up Display (HUD)\nUp-front Control (UFC)\nOption Display Unit (ODU)\nMultipurpose Color Displays (MPCD)\nVREST Computer (for jet-borne flight)\nAir Data Computer (ADC)\nEnvironmental Control System (ECS)\nOn-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS)\nRealistic weapons, sensor, and defensive systems include:\nAir-to-Air and Air-to-Ground GAU-12 Equalizer 25 mm (0.984 in) 5-barreled Rotary cannon pod\n6 under-wing pylon stations holding up to 9,200 lb (4,200 kg) of payload which include:\nAIM-9 Sidewinder or similar-sized infrared-guided missiles\nAGM-65 Maverick Air-to-Surface missiles\nMark 80 series of unguided bombs (including 3 kg [6.6 lb] and 14 kg [31 lb] practice bombs)\nPaveway series of Laser-Guided Bombs (LGBs)\nJoint Direct Attack Munitions (GBU-38, GBU-32, and GBU-54)\nMark 20 Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs)\nAN/AAQ-28V LITENING targeting pod\nALQ-164 ECM Pod\nSeveral skins\nDetailed Operational Manual and Pocket guide\nInstant Action, Single, and Training Missions\nDetailed representation of the USS Tarawa (LHA-1), lead ship of her class.\nFor more information and support, please visit: RAZBAM\n\nFree disk space is required: 2.25 Gb","cover":"https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/652/DCS-AV-8B_700x1000_v2.jpg","images":["https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/78b/dcs-world-12-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/8c3/dcs-world-11-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/1d6/dcs-world-10-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/c03/dcs-world-09-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/583/dcs-world-08-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/088/dcs-world-07-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/4ec/dcs-world-06-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/ca5/dcs-world-05-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/7ce/dcs-world-04-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/214/dcs-world-03-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/995/dcs-world-02-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/587/dcs-world-01-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg","https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/26d/dcs-world-00-av-8b-vstol-harrier-fighter-jet-simulator.jpg"],"video":"UMc3c4JqoyM","category":"JET_ENGINE_PLANE","miles":6990,"price":69.99,"isTrial":true,"userManual":{"map":{"DE":"https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/upload/iblock/08b/Kurzeinweisung_zur_AV-8B_Harrier.pdf"}},"guide":{"map":{"EN":"https://assets.chucksguides.com/pdf/DCS%20AV-8B%20Harrier%20Guide.pdf"}}},{"id":24,"title":"DCS: NS 430 Navigation System for SA342 Gazelle by Eagle Dynamics, Polychop Simulations","description":"The NS 430 for the SA342 Gazelle module integrates the NS 430 panel directly into the SA342 Gazelle cockpit (not as a pop-up display).\n\nFor work of this module, you must also own the DCS: NS 430 and DCS: SA342 Gazelle by Polychop Simulations.\n\nThe NS 430 GPS navigation system, is an optional add-on module for DCS World aircraft.
